# Memorize Your Colors

## Overview

*Memorize Your Colors* was written for an educational purpose to serve pre-college students in grades k-12. It is a color matching game to stimulate the thinking and memory of the youth as well as teach colors and comparison. *Memorize Your Colors* is copy-righted and any use of the code without permission from the owners/developers is prohibitted. 

*Memorize Your Colors* is a classic style matching game but with a twist. There is a combo score for each match you get in a row. There is a wildcard on each level that has an odd amount of cards. The wildcard is a match within itself. You are given health and each wrong match will subtract one from the health count. There is also a high score tracker that is kept track of through a cloud database. The colors are randomly generated through a RGB generator so some colors may be close together so pay attention.
