# Memorize Your Colors

## Overview

*Memorize Your Colors* was written for an educational purpose to serve pre-college students in grades k-12. It is a color matching game to stimulate the thinking and memory of the youth as well as teach colors and comparison. *Memorize Your Colors* is copy-righted and any use of the code without permission from the owners/developers is prohibitted. 

*Memorize Your Colors* is a classic style matching game but with a twist. There is a combo score for each match you get in a row. There is a wildcard on each level that has an odd amount of cards. The wildcard is a match within itself which also adds to your health. You are given health and each wrong match will subtract one from the health count. There is also a high score tracker that will allow you to see the highest local score. The colors are randomly generated through a RGB generator so some colors may be close together so pay attention.

## Development Environment

This software was written in Python with the libraries of pygame, time, json, random, and math. It was written over a course of 5 two-week sprints. The version control system used was Git, Github, and Github Desktop. There are 5 developers who helped in the creation of this project: Brennon Laney, Andrew Leland, Bradley Payne, Bryan Loertscher, and Jessica Payne.

### Disclaimer
Many of the sound effects (specifically those beginning with "hurray" or "wrong") were taken from the files of an old computer game from the 90s called *Living Letters*. We do not claim any right or ownership of these sound effects, we merely appreciate their excellence.
